The user information will not be removed after reloading or closing the web page. 
Anytime you want to come back to a project with local storage, all the information will still be there.
and for my excuse :) i had a much better todolist with a great UI but something was wrong with it's buttons :))) and no matter how much i tried it doesn't work correctly and perfect...
but i will absolutely fix it later:)
